This is a simple ToDo mini project using React.JS

I am currently studying React so please bear with me.

How to run the program:

Open your terminal and locate the folder
Once you're on the terminal run the following command
npm install
npm run dev

npm install - This will install the necessary node modules
npm run dev - This will run the program in the dev environment and will give you a localhost link where you can run the project
